[Данная информация на русском языке](README.RU.md)
Properties Ribbon is the scripts complex for quick navigating and adjusting of track, item or another controls. This is a ReaScript complex intended for [REAPER](https://reaper.fm/) users with non-visual access and provides the extended control ability.
*Please note:* The accessibility plugin [OSARA](https://osara.reaperaccessibility.com/) should be installed for provide the speech output.
## Why Properties Ribbon? ##
### extended elements properties ###
OSARA provides only basic controls for track or items. You only can adjust the volume, pan and mute/unmute track or item. Yeah, you can use the Reaper actions to set the needed state, but not all parameters you there would find in the actions list. More over you have to set this action to keyboard shortcuts and remember this after. Are you really want to spend your time to cram this in your mind?
Properties Ribbon proposes to use six actions to get any control value for track, master track or item like you are working in a GUI and adjust this quickly. Properties Ribbon uses Reaper API to control its properties, so it works fast and accurate.
## Working with group of selected elements ##
Properties Ribbon can work with group of selected elements, so you can adjust the volume, pan or width in for example twenty  track by onetime.
## Flexibility ##
The Properties Ribbon complex is very flexible. If you know the LUA scripting language and you're known with Reaper API, You can write needed properties list if it isn't realized yet and this properties will be available!
