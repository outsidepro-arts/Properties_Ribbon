Let me say a few word before starts
LUA - is not object oriented programming language, but very flexible. Its flexibility allows to realize OOP easy via metatables. In this scripts the pseudo OOP has been used, therefore we have to understand some terms.
.1 When i'm speaking "Class" i mean the metatable variable with some fields.
2. When i'm speaking "Method" i mean a function attached to a field or submetatable field.
When i was starting write this scripts complex i imagined this as real OOP. But in consequence the scripts structure has been reunderstanded as current structure. It has been turned out more comfort as for writing new properties table, as for call this from main script engine.
After this preambula, let me begin.

local projectLayout = initLayout("Project management actions")

function projectLayout.canProvide()
return true
end

projectLayout:registerProperty(composeSimpleProperty(40021))
projectLayout:registerProperty(composeSimpleProperty(40015))
projectLayout:registerProperty(composeSimpleProperty(40098))

return projectLayout
